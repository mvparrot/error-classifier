# Error Classifier

This Monash Winter Project will use machine learning tools and cutting-edge tennis tracking data to find accurate ways to categorize tennis shots as errors or winners. 

This project will be co-supervised by Dianne Cook <dicook@monash.edu> and Stephanie Kovalchik <skovalchik@tennis.com.au>.

Dean Dagan is working on this project.
